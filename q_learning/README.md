3) Run q_learning_game.py to Train the game and also see the results.                                           
----------> To train the game Run initialize.py and q_learning_game.py as it is.                                    
----------> To see the results of training , uncomment the lines  253 and 254 in q_learning_game.py and run it

4) For q_learning_game.py use the following arguments to get their respective results                                        
      --fps to set number of frames per second
      --iter to set number of iterations for the game to run
      --dump_hitmasks to store hitmasks in a file
      --verbose to get output [iteration | score] in stdout
